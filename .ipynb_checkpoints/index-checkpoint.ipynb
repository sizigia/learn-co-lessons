    "From previous lessons, you know that the derivative is equal to the slope of the tangent line along a graph.  The importance of the derivative is that it tells us the rate of change at a given point.  In previous lessons, we discussed the broad problem as how to calculate the rate of change for a function at a given point: that is, the derivative.  We said that the derivative of a function at a certain point is just the slope of the function at that point.  And to calculate that slope of a function when the change in the input is zero, we simply make our change in input smaller and smaller to approach a change of zero, and see what our $ \\Delta y/\\Delta x $ converges upon.\n",

    "So far, we have calculated the derivative by changing our delta as reflected in the table above, and seeing the convergance.  However, mathematicians have given us shortcuts to calculate the derivative, and that is what we'll learn about here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The power rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The first rule for us to learn is the power rule.  The power rule states is expressed as the following.  Given the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^r $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the derivative, $f'(x)$ is: \n",
    "$$ f'(x) = r*x^{r-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This says that if variable, like $x$, that is raised to a exponent $r$, then the derivative of that function is the exponent $r$ multiplied by the variable, with the variablae raised to one minus the original exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, consider the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2 $$\n",
    "$$f'(x) = 2*x^{2-1} =  2*x^1 = 2*x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about what this is saying about our function, $f(x) = x^2 $.  It says, for $f(x) = x ^2$, a small change in $x$ produces an increase in $f(x) $ equal to 2 times the $ x $ value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So when $ x = 2 $, we solve for the derivative at that point by simply plugging in $ 2 $ whenever we see $ x $. \n",
    "So as: \n",
    "$$ f'(x) = 2*x $$\n",
    "$$f'(2) = 2*2 = f'(2) = 4 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And when $ x = 10 $, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(10) = 2*10 = 20$$ "
