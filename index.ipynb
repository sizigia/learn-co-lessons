    "In this lab, you apply nearest neighbors technique to help a taxi company predict the length of their rides.  Imagine that we are hired to consult for LiftOff, a limo and taxi service that is just opening up in NYC.  Liftoff wants it's taxi drivers to target longer rides, as the longer the ride the more money it makes.  LiftOff has the following theory:\n",

There are fancy formulas to ensure that we **train** our algorithm so that our formula is optimized for all data, but here let's see different $k$ values manually.  This is the gist of choosing our $k$ value:\n",
