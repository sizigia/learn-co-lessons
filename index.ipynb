    "In the last lesson we derived the nearest neighbor formula.  Nearest neighbors is a powerful algorithm because it is based on the premise that data that based on proximity, we can predict other attributes about an individual.  For example, those who live in a particular neighborhood may be more likely to be a particular age, or have a similar neighborhood, and just based on proximity we can then see if their likelihood to purchase a product approximates that of their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll see how the nearest neighbors algorithm allows us to make predictions with data.  In doing so we'll also see our workflow for machine learning in general.  And we will see some common struggles that we have when applying a machine learning algorithm. "
