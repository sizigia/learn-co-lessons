    "In the last lesson we derived the nearest neighbor formula.  Nearest neighbors is a powerful algorithm because it allows us to predict other attributes about people using their proximity data.  For example, those who live in a particular neighborhood may be more likely to be a certain age or have similar interests.  Using proximity, we might even be able to determine whether their likelihood to purchase a product approximates that of their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll see how the nearest neighbors algorithm allows us to make predictions with data.  We will also look at the workflow for machine learning in general and see some of the common struggles that we experience when applying a machine learning algorithm. "

The training dataset is used for tweaking the algorithm, as we just saw, so that it minimizes the error or some other metric.  Once the algorithm is optimized, they study how well their algorithm performs on something it is not molded to, called test data.  If the algorithm performs well on this test data, it is ready for use and can make new predictions."
