This means that the variable is available throughout the file it is declared in - inside of functions and out.  Variables declared inside of functions are local variables, and are available to be referenced from inside of the function in which they are declared.  However, we can have the data that a local variable points to be thrown over the walls of the function by using the `return` keyword.  The combination of local variables with returning specific data allows us to encapsulate our code inside of a function, and be explicitly state what should be returned, and thus accessible from outside of the function."
