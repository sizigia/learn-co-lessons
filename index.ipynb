That's the benefit of a library, we can get methods that do not come out of the box with Python.  So we use the `read_excel` data to read our excel file, by providing the name of the file, `cities.xlsx`, and the preceding `./` just indicates that the file is found in the current folder.  Finally with the line `travel_df.to_dict('records')` we return a list of our dictionaries representing our data.  You can see that when we access the first element of this list, we it returns our first dictionary.  "

    "In this section we saw how to get our data from the outside world and into Python.  The purpose isn't to understand all of this code right now, but rather to see how easily we can start working with outside data.  As we become better at Python, the usefulness of taking data and operating on it in code rather than a spreadsheet will become more apparent.  But that doesn't mean we can't get step outside of Python sandbox now.  It's not too difficult to take some data we may already have, and begin to use it with Python.  In the next section, we'll use a lab to get data from excel and work with lists."
