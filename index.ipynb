We indicate to Python that we are writing a string by surrounding our content with quotation marks. Once we do this, we can operate on this string by calling methods like `upper` or `endswith`. We identified a general pattern for calling methods on datatypes: 'datatype-dot-method name-parentheses'.\n",

We saw the importance of guessing and experimentation, and how doing so can give us error messages, which provide clues. We also saw how to ask questions about a datatype by calling 'help' followed by the datatype name like `help(str)`.  Finally, we saw we can ask Google.  This mechanism of exploration is a skill we'll build up over time and this course will provide guidance and practice on along the way."
