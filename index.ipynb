So we use the `read_excel` data to read our excel file, by providing the name of the file, `cities.xlsx`, and the preceding `./` just indicates the the file can be cound in the current folder.  Finally with the line `travel_df.to_dict('records')` we return a list of our dictionaries representing our data.  "

The purpose isn't to understand all of this code right now, but rather to see how easily we can start working with outside data.  As we become better at Python, the usefulness of taking data and operating on it in code rather than a spreadsheet will become more apparent.  But that doesn't mean we can't get step outside of Python sandbox now.  It's not too difficult to take some data we may already have, and begin to use it with Python.
