Then we calculate the distance by knowing that the square of one side, $a^2$ is $(x_{1} - x_{2})^2$ or the x coordinate of one point minus the x coordinate of the other point squared, and the square of the length of the other side, that is $b^2$, is $(y_{1} - y_{2})^2$, the y coordinate of one point minus the y coordinate of the other point squared.  So this gives us $(x_{1} - x_{2})^2$ + $(y_{1} - y_{2})^2$ = $c^2$ or, solving for c, $c = \\sqrt{(x_{1} - x_{2})^2 + (y_{1} - y_{2})^2}$."
