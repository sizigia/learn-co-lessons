### Learning Objectives

- Understand how for loops can help us reduce repetition
- Understand the syntax of for loops 

### Picking up where we last left off

In the last lesson, we worked with some of our travel data.  Let's retrieve a list with our travel information again from excel.  First, we read the information from excel as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a location.  And we assign this list to the variable `cities`.


```python
import pandas
file_name = './cities.xlsx'
travel_df = pandas.read_excel(file_name)
cities = travel_df.to_dict('records')
```

Next, we retrieve the first three city names, stored as the `'City'` attribute of each dictionary, and `'Population'` of each of the cities.  Then we plot the names as our `x_values` and the populations as our `y_values`.


```python
import plotly

plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)

x_values = [cities[0]['City'], cities[1]['City'], cities[2]['City']]
y_values = [cities[0]['Population'], cities[1]['Population'], cities[2]['Population']]
trace_first_three_pops = {'x': x_values, 'y': y_values, 'type': 'bar'}
plotly.offline.iplot([trace_first_three_pops])
```

Of course, as you may have spotted, there is a good amount of repetition in displaying this data.  Just take a look at how we retrieved the data for our `x_values` and `y_values`.  


```python
x_values = [cities[0]['City'], cities[1]['City'], cities[2]['City']]
y_values = [cities[0]['Population'], cities[1]['Population'], cities[2]['Population']]
```

So in this lesson, we will use our `for` loop to display information about our travel locations with less repetition.

### Working with the For Loop

Our `cities` list contains information about the top 12 cities.  For our upcoming iteration tasks, it will be useful to have a list of the numbers 0 through 11.  Use what we know about `len` and `range`to generate a list of numbers 1 through 11.  Assign this to a variable called `city_indices`.


```python
city_indices = None
city_indices # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
```

Now we want to create labels for each of the cities. We'll provide a list of the `city_names` for you. 


```python
city_names = ['Buenos Aires',
 'Toronto',
 'Pyeongchang',
 'Marakesh',
 'Albuquerque',
 'Los Cabos',
 'Greenville',
 'Archipelago Sea',
 'Walla Walla Valley',
 'Salina Island',
 'Solta',
 'Iguazu Falls']
```

Your task is to assign the variable `names_and_ranks` to a list, with each element equal to the city name and it's corresponding rank.  For example, the first element would be, `"1. Buenos Aires"` and the second would be `"2. Toronto"`.  Use a `for` loop and the lists `city_indices` and `city_names` to accomplish this.


```python
names_and_ranks = ['change this to different elements'] # make sure the list is empty
```


```python
names_and_ranks[0] # '1. Buenos Aires'
names_and_ranks[1] # '2. Toronto'
names_and_ranks[-1] # '12. Iguazu Falls'
```

Ok, now let's create a new variable called `city_populations`.  Use a `for` loop to iterate through `cities` and have `city_populations` equal to each of the populations.


```python
city_populations = []
```


```python
city_populations[0] # 2891000
city_populations[1] # 2800000
city_populations[-1] # 0
```

Great! Now we can begin to plot this data.  First, let's create a trace of our populations and set it to the variable `trace_populations`.


```python
trace_populations = {'x': names_and_ranks, 
                     'y': city_populations, 
                     'text': names_and_ranks, 
                     'type': 'bar', 
                     'name': 'populations'}
```


```python
import plotly
plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
plotly.offline.iplot([trace_populations])
```

Now we want declare a variable called `city_areas` that points to a list of all of the areas of the cities.  Let's use a `for` loop to iterate through our `cities` and have `city_areas` equal to each area of the city.  


```python
city_areas = []
```


```python
trace_areas = {'x': names_and_ranks, 'y': city_areas, 'text': names_and_ranks, 'type': 'bar', 'name': 'areas'}
```


```python
import plotly
plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
plotly.offline.iplot([trace_populations, trace_areas])
```

### Summary

In this section we saw how we can use `for` loops to go through elements of a list and perform the same operation on each.  By using `for` loops we were able to reduce the amount of code that we wrote and while also writing more expressive code.
